## Input

The program takes user inputs for adding cities, which include the city name, country, and population. These inputs are collected through a form in the "Add City" screen. The program uses React state to manage the list of cities dynamically, starting empty and updating as users add new entries.

## Process

Once a city is added, the program updates the **cities state** and re-renders the city list. React Router manages navigation, ensuring smooth redirection between pages. Clicking on a city displays its details on the same page. The program follows a  **single-page application (SPA) approach** , avoiding full-page reloads.

## Output

The output consists of a  **city list display** , an  **individual city details page** , and **real-time updates** when a new city is added. The user experience is enhanced through structured UI elements, navigation, and state management.
