# cs628-pe-Neha_Arora

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Input

**The program accepts user input in the form of tasks to be added to the todo list. The user types a task into the input field and clicks the "Add Task" button.**

## Process

**When the user adds a task, the program processes the input by storing it in an array of tasks. The program also handles the deletion of tasks by filtering the array to exclude the deleted task.**

## Output

**The program displays the list of tasks in the todo list. Each task is displayed with a delete button next to it. When a task is deleted, the program updates the display to reflect the new list of tasks.**
